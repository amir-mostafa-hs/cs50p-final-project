S1: Hello everyone! I'm Amir Mostafa Haji Sadeghian, and today I'm excited to present my final project for Harvard's CS50P course - a Cryptocurrency Price Analyzer.


S2: This command-line tool helps users analyze cryptocurrency prices using the CoinGecko API. It provides real-time price analysis, visualizations, and data export for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Solana.


S3: The project uses key libraries from CS50P like 'requests' for API calls and 'pandas' for data processing. I've also implemented command-line arguments and added matplotlib for visualizations and pytest for testing.


S4: The project is organized into core components:
- A main script handling core functionality
- Utility modules for API fetching, time calculations, and plotting
- And a test suite for code verification

This modular approach keeps our code clean and organized.


S5: Let me show you how it works. We use a simple command:
`python project.py` followed by two arguments:
--coin for selecting your cryptocurrency
and --time for choosing your analysis period


S6: For example, if we run 'python project.py --coin BTC --time lw', the program will:
1. Fetch Bitcoin's last week prices
2. Show price statistics
3. Generate a price chart
4. And save data in CSV and PNG formats

Let me demonstrate this...
[Here you can show the actual command execution]


Next: As you can see, the program provides:
- Daily price information
- Key statistics like highest and lowest prices
- A clear visualization of the price trend
- And automatically saved files for further analysis


S7: Thank you for watching! - This project showcases practical applications of CS50P concepts. Thank you, Professor David Malan and the CS50 team, for this amazing learning experience.

If you're interested in trying it yourself, you can find the complete code and documentation in my GitHub repository.

This is Amir Mostafa Haji Sadeghian, and this was CS50P!
